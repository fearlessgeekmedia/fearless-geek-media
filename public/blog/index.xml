Minimal. Geeky. That&amp;rsquo;s how I personally like things. I&amp;rsquo;m a geek. I like retro computers.
I wanted a website that fit me. The previous design was great. However, I don&amp;rsquo;t feel it fit me. I like to code. I love being in the Linux terminal.
Yes, I can definitely design a website that is more elegant. And I do that. Elegance isn&amp;rsquo;t the goal here, as it&amp;rsquo;s not the goal of every website.</description><content>&lt;p>Retro.

&lt;p>Yes, I can definitely design a website that is more elegant. And I do that. Elegance isn&amp;rsquo;t the goal here, as it&amp;rsquo;s not the goal of every website.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While I do like to do elegant designs, I&amp;rsquo;m not an elegant person. But I think there&amp;rsquo;s an elegance about being simplistic and retro. I think there&amp;rsquo;s an elegance about being real. In fact, one of the definitions of elegance is &amp;ldquo;the quality of being pleasingly ingenious and simple; neatness&amp;rdquo;. And in doing this, I hope you see who I am! And when you&amp;rsquo;re my client, I want do do something that expresses who you are, what your business is, and how it provides value to your customers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So welcome to the new Fearless Geek Media website!&lt;/p></content></item></channel></rss>
