Retro. Minimal. Geeky. That's how I personally like things. I'm a geek. I like retro computers. 

I wanted a website that fit me. The previous design was great. However, I don't feel it fit me. I like to code. I love being in the Linux terminal. 

Yes, I can definitely design a website that is more elegant. And I do that. Elegance isn't the goal here, as it's not the goal of every website. 

While I do like to do elegant designs, I'm not an elegant person. But I think there's an elegance about being simplistic and retro. I think there's an elegance about being real. In fact, one of the definitions of elegance is "the quality of being pleasingly ingenious and simple; neatness". And in doing this, I hope you see who I am! And when you're my client, I want do do something that expresses who you are, what your business is, and how it provides value to your customers.

So welcome to the new Fearless Geek Media website!
