This is the original Fearless Geek Media logo. I've since updated the logo, as you see. 

I liked how casual the text was and I felt it was friendly to new clients. However, I dont' feel this exactly expressed who I am. I'm a geek. The logo itself showed that, but the text didn't.

With the new logo that you see throughout the website, I've added a little more color to it, and added a terminal-style font. Can you get much more geeky than going to a terminal style? In fact, this whole website is in a terminal style.
