This is actually a loading screen for a computer roleplaying game I'm working on. The series is called Tryonian Chronicles, and the first game of the series will be called Guardians of Time.

The game itself takes place on a planet called Tryonius, which is an Earth-like planet but with three rings, and they have three other planets within their star system that are also habitable. The game incorporates both sci-fi and fantasy elements.

Tryonius, being a three-ringed planet, is why we have the three-ringed planet in the logo.
