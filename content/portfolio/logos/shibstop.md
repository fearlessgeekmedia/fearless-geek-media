![Shibstop Logo S](/portfolio-images/logos/shibstop_S.png)

This is the Shibstop logo. Actually, you’ll notice two versions of the logo. One is just the S.

The S has ears. These are supposed to be the ears of a Shiba Inu dog. This is actually based on the Shiba Inu coin logo, which is shown below.

From what I’ve been told, I could have used the Shiba Inu logo with no problems, as the creator of the coin was anonymous and the code for the cryptocurrency is open source. Supposedly this makes the image open source as well. However, I know it’s not true for all cryptocurrencies, and I could not find anything official about the Shiba Inu logo. So I created my own logo without the Shiba Inu logo, which is fine, because that’s just one more thing I can add to the portfolio! But you could easily see how the Shiba Inu logo could fit inside the S.

On Facebook for the profile picture of the Shibstop page, I felt it was best just to use the S. I could see transitioning to just the S in the future as the logo for Shibstop rather than using the whole name.
