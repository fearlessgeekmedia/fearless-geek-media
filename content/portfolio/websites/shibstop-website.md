’m a Shiba Inu coin holder, and I want to see the price of the coin go up. This website is a way I am helping the coin’s value. 5% of profits are converted to Shiba Inu and burned, thus increasing the scarcity of the coin and over time, increasing the value.

One of the problems with the Shiba Ibu token is there’s just way too many of them, and without burning a good portion of the supply, it can never reach the value many cryptocurrency investors are hoping for.
